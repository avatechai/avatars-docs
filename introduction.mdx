Inspired by the developers' creativity of how LLM agents can be, the SDK is designed with the 2 observations in mind.

1. Uesful Agent is context-aware and dynamic
  - Switching styles, voice and LLM models should be as easy as switching api.
  - Everything is standardised with appropriate modular abstraction for the avatar. 
  - innovation in various domains of avatars are stackable and reusable. 
2. User expect instant feedback and have
  - as such, we design it to be fast, responsive, and programmable in minute details.
  - we provdie off-the-box animation solution while agent is using different tools and components. 
  - We abstract the complexity of building avatars across styles
