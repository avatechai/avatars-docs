## Create avatars

You can generate avatars from our [labs](https://labs.avatech.ai). With the help of text-to-image AI model, you can create different avatar by only describing your imagination.

After generated your avatar, you can click the 'view code' button at the top-right corner to copy the avatarId. Then replace the avatarId inside the 'useAvatar' hook.

## Avatar refinement

We provide different services to make your own avatar comes alive:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Lip-sync">
    The avatars generated from our labs support real-time lip-sync based on audio provided to our sdk.

    To make your avatar start talking, you need to first create a new **externalAvatarVoiceService**.

    ```jsx
    const externalAvatarVoiceService = new ExternalVoiceSourceService();
    ```

    Then you need to call setAudioContextAndSource() hook from externalAvatarVoiceService to set the audioContext and audioPlayer.

    ```jsx
    externalAvatarVoiceService.setAudioContextAndSource(
      audioContext,
      audioPlayer
    );
    ```
    Audio context and Audio Player can be created by the code below.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Audio Context">
        ```jsx
        const audioContext = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Audio Player">
        ```jsx
        const audioPlayer = new Audio();
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Once you start playing audio from the audioPlayer, your avatar will automatically start lip-sync!

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Expression">
    you can set the avatar expression by calling the function below:
    ```jsx
    context.current.client.setAvatarEmotion('your emotion')
    ```

    you can get all the emotion avatar supported by calling the function below:
    ```jsx
    context.current.client.getAvatarAllEmotion('your emotion')
    ```
    
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
