## Technology used

#### Avatar

Our `Avatars` SDK currently provides web support. Depending on developer's integration and avatar type we have the following third party dependencies:
- [Live2d](https://www.live2d.com/en/download/cubism-sdk/)
- [Rive (MIT)](https://rive.app/runtimes)

Which is used for rendering the avatar model on web.

<Note>While the SDK will install the dependencies for you, you dont have to install the SDK yourself.</Note>

The `Avatars` SDK is built as a pipeline on interfacing different avatars and bridging them closer to users. We are currently working on supporting more avatar types and platforms.

### Blendshape

The sdk will analyse the incoming audio and create blendshapes mappings for the avatar. Currently these thrid party libraries are used for the blendshape mapping:
