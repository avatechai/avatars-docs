## Make your avatar alive

To make your avatar alive, three different type of services is needed:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Large language model">
    We support [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/) or [Vercel AI](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) to generate novel human-like content for your avatars.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Avatar providers" >
    We support [Live2D](https://www.live2d.com/en/) or [Rive](https://rive.app/) **mouth-sync supported** avatar.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Voice providers">
    A Text to Speech voice generation providers is needed. These voice provider will generate voices based on the text input, so that avatars can respond through speech.
    Currently we support [Elevenlabs](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/) to generate the voice of your avatars.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

An example of connecting a Rive character to Langchain is provided below.

## Example

To get this started, You need to provide a audio service API key and put key inside the "AvatarDisplay" tag to make your avatars start talking.

You should also provide a mouth-sync supported avatar and put the url or file inside the "AvatarDisplay" tag.

```jsx
import { AvatarDisplay } from "@avatechai/avatars/react";

// you can replace the url with any rive model that support mouth-sync.
const riveAvatarUrl = 'https://avatech-avatar-dev1.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/hey%2C_ho%21_let%27s_go%21.riv';

const elevenLab = new ElevenLabVoiceService(
  "<apiKey>",
  "eleven_monolingual_v1",
  "<voiceId>"
);

function App() {
  return <AvatarDisplay src={riveAvatarUrl} audioService={elevenLab}/>;
}
```
